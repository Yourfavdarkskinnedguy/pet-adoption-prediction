# Pet Adoption Predictor (Web App)

The Pet Adoption Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of pets being adopted based on their attributes such as age, breed, and health status. This project aims to assist pet adoption platforms in efficiently matching pets with potential adopters, helping more pets find loving homes.

## Features

- **Accurate Predictions**: Utilizes a machine learning model to estimate adoption likelihood.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enables users to input pet details and receive predictions.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Processes real-world pet adoption data for insights.
- **Scalable Design**: Suitable for integration into existing adoption platforms.

## Technologies Used

- ****Programming Language**: Python**
- **Framework**: Streamlit for hosting
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

## **Dataset**

* **Source**: [kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
* **Attributes**: Includes features such as pet age, breed, size, health status, sterilization status, and adoption speed.
* **Preprocessing**: Missing values handled, categorical data encoded, and features scaled for model training.

## **Model**

* **Architecture**: Built using RandomForestClassifier.
* **Training Process**: Dataset split into training and validation sets. Hyperparameter tuning performed for optimiza

## **Installation**
